To extend task 2 with a non-zero time for replacing trucks, we simply added a sleep function that will be called any time a truck does not have enough space for another package. When a truck
is to be dispatched, the sleep function present in the timer module provided in Erlang will be called with a random Sleep_Time. This will stop the designated thread for 1 to 1000 milliseconds,
simulating the time a truck needs to be replaced.

Our program ensures that conveyors pause their operation while waiting for a truck to be replaced through the use of the acknowledgment system described in task1's report.
By sending the acknowledgment only after the sleep function is called, our system ensures that conveyors wait for the trucks to be replaced, maintaining correctness.

Usage:

To run our program we use the following commands -

    To compile the code we use: c(task3).
    To run the code we use: task3:start(N_TRUCKS, MAX_CAPACITY, MAX_PCK_SIZE) where N_TRUCKS represents the number of trucks in the system, MAX_CAPACITY represents the capacity of each truck
    and MAX_PCK_SIZE represents the maximum size of each package.
